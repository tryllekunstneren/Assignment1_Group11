    "We started by sending a GET request to the target URL and parsing its HTML content using BeautifulSoup. Recognizing that names were enclosed within `<i>` tags, we extracted their text and replaced newline characters for cleaner data. To address cases where multiple names appeared in a single tag, we split the text using “, ” as a delimiter. Converting the resulting list to a set removed duplicates, ensuring only unique names remained. Finally, we created a DataFrame for further validation. We assessed the quality of our final list by verifying the unique count of names and manually inspecting the formatting to confirm consistency and accuracy in retrieval. This systematic approach enabled us to maximize the extraction of correctly formatted names while minimizing redundancy."

    "Centola’s experiment used custom-made data, allowing for controlled conditions, precise measurement of social influence, and elimination of confounding variables. Researchers could manipulate network structures and directly observe behavioral changes, ensuring strong internal validity. However, the artificial setting may reduce external validity, as participants might behave differently in real-world contexts. Additionally, sample sizes are often smaller due to resource constraints. Nicolaides’s study used ready-made data from real-world sources, providing large-scale insights into disease transmission and high external validity. However, this data contains biases, lacks control over confounding factors, and may have measurement inaccuracies, such as missing data or inconsistencies in self-reported behaviors. Since observational data is not designed for experimental purposes, causality is harder to establish, requiring careful statistical modeling to infer relationships."

    "Centola’s controlled experiment ensures causality by isolating specific variables, making it easier to identify the mechanisms driving social contagion. However, the findings may not fully capture complex social behaviors outside the lab, limiting their generalizability. The artificial setting may also fail to reflect spontaneous, large-scale diffusion processes. In contrast, Nicolaides’s study reflects real-world patterns of human mobility and interactions, offering valuable insights into disease spread. Yet, the reliance on observational data means that multiple external factors, such as policy interventions or demographic differences, could influence the results. While Nicolaides’s study provides practical, large-scale implications, it requires careful interpretation to avoid confounding correlations with causation. These methodological differences shape how confidently each study’s results can be applied to broader social contexts, particularly in policymaking and behavioral interventions."
